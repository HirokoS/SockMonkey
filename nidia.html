            <h2>2012: The 50th Anniversary of the Sock Monkey Group</h2>
            <h3>Sock Monkeys for Sick Children at UNC Childrens Hospital</h3>
            <p>By Nidia Sharlock</p>

        <p>Worn and used materials from home sewing projects have long been recycled into soft comfort toys for children. In 1932, the Nelson Knitting Company introduced a brown and cream work sock with a distinctive RED HEEL and named them Original Rockfords. In 1954, the company began including the pattern for the sock monkey in every package, and as they say, the rest is history. It was the perfect material for a child’s comfort toy – soft, durable, and easy to design for girls or boys. Just as each child is unique in looks and personality, so is each sock monkey. Such a simple gift to comfort sick children, relieve their anxiety, distract from discomfort, and provide companionship!</p>
        <p>By the late 1950’s, sock monkeys had become an iconic folk toy. Maybe this is why they became the iconic toy for the UNC Childrens Hospital. Each one is still made from a pair of Original Rockford Red Heel Socks. Each one is made with love by hospital volunteers to say, “Here’s a special friend to give you a smile and a hug and keep you company.”</p>
        <p>Since the monkeys are currently used to help prepare children for their treatments and procedures, they are given out by the Recreational Therapy & Child Life Specialist staff. Their “creators” stuff them with love and good wishes and stitch on a smile and use their own imaginations to picture each monkey in its new family.</p>
        <p> Through the years, many volunteers have spent countless hours stuffing, designing, and stitching their monkeys. For many, life would not be complete without a monkey-in-process sitting by their workbox at home. “Monkey Ladies” range in age from young adults to 80’s & 90’s. They come from many parts of the United States and Japan and recently China. They share the common bond of service to their community and compassion for all children who are ill.</p>
        <p> Thousands and thousands of sock monkeys have been born in Chapel Hill and have travelled with their new brothers or sisters to every part of North Carolina to provide memories of a caring community. </p>
