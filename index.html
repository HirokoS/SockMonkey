            <h2>What is Monkey Makers?</h2>
            <p>We're a volunteer group making sock monkeys for the kids who are in-patients at UNC Children's Hospital. Monkey Junction is our website to show our activities to anybody who is intersted in sewing and volunteering.<br>
            "Volunteering + Sock Monkey = Love!"</p>

        <div class="home-intro">
            <h2>How sock monkeys will help child in-patients?</h2>
            <p>The monkey can serve as a companion to the child during and after the hospital stay. The child life specialists at the Children's Hospital can demonstrate on the monkeys and show what will be done and what can be expected to their medical procedures. The monkeys will help the children to get rid of fears and anxiety by going through each medical process together.</p>
